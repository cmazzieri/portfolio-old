<p>My main goal as a web developer is to keep up to date with the latest technologies that are being used in the industry.</p>
<p>As I gain more experience I will start focusing my career in the area of Web Mapping Applications.</p>
<p>I am also planning to keep digging further into the world of CMS-free websites which are growing in popularity. This website itself has been created using Jekyll and I have integrated a customized Twitter-Bootstrap template into it.</p>
